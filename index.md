# Hi
I'm Hash, a deep learning engineer and researcher. Here's some cool work I've done:

## RealTalk
[RealTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWK_iYBl8cA) was a state-of-the-art speech synthesis system. It was featured by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/the-weekly/deepfake-joe-rogan.html), [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/597yba/ai-generated-fake-joe-rogan-voice-dessa), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/this-ai-generated-joe-rogan-voice-sounds-eerily-like-th-1834842151), and others.

## Next Week Tonight (NWT)
[NWT](https://youtu.be/HctArhfIGs4) is an expressive speech-to-video model. You can view some experiments on the [demo page](https://next-week-tonight.github.io/NWT/).
